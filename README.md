For this project, we manually collected a dataset of tomato images from the Balkhu area, capturing both ripe and unripe tomatoes in various lighting and environmental conditions to ensure diversity and robustness. After collecting the raw data, we performed preprocessing steps including resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve the model's performance and generalization.
